# IATI code examples

Here you'll find a small selection of code examples written to make use of IATI's APIs, data, and tools. Unless otherwise noted, all code is licensed under [GNU Affero General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html). In other words, you are free to modify, distribute, warranty, or commercially use this code as long as it's also licensed under the GNU Affero GPL. If you have an idea for a code example to host here, or want to see an existing example written in a different programming language, please let us know at [code@iatistandard.org](mailto:code@iatistandard.org).

Our code examples include:

## Applying codelist names to numerical codes

One common operation required to make semantic use of IATI data is the transformation of machine-readable codes into human-readable names. Below are some examples of how to make these transformations. These examples assume you're already familiar with the IATI Datastore API; if not, please see the documentation on the IATI API Gateway: [https://developer.iatistandard.org/](https://developer.iatistandard.org/).

We have examples of how to download our codelist mappings, download all codelists, and match code values downloaded from the Datastore in JSON to their codelist names in the following languages:

- [Javascript](/Javascript/codelists/index.js)
- [Python](/Python/codelists/index.py)
- [R](/R/codelists/index.R)

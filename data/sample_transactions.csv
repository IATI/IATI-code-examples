UNICEF supported MoHFW and States to conduct RI reviews and to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on RI. UNICEF supported MoHFW in development and regular updating of RI guidelines in the COVID-19 pandemic setting\, including staggered RI sessions and the use of COVID-19 appropriate behaviors like use of masks\, physical distancing\, and handwashing. UNICEF also supported in the PCV introduction (UP\, Odisha\, Telangana\, Maharashtra\, West Bengal) and in the design and implementation of a special catch-up campaign for RI (Mission Ramdhenu in North-East states covering 72\,777 children aged 0-2 years). UNICEF supported in implementation of tribal RI strategy in 2 districts and urban RI strategy in 3 corporations in Maharashtra. UNICEF provided support for cold chain assessment to MoHFW and states and in setting up of new cold chain points (Chhattisgarh\, Nagaland\, Jharkhand) and mapping of health facilities requiring solar equipment across India. New CCE procurement for COVID-19 vaccine introduction has indirectly benefited target infants & pregnant women. UNICEF supported in revision of RI monitoring formats\, hosted on the Supportive Supervision app\, to include COVID-19 behavior specific questions. In Q3 2021 alone\, 35\,094 RI and 33\,339 COVID-19 vaccination session sites were monitored using modified checklists. UNICEF leveraged partnerships with CSO (Doctors for You in Maharashtra to conduct 230 outreach sessions and 236 camps for immunization) and private sector (pediatricians in Gujarat) to strengthen RI.\nOut of all CCE\, 480 solar direct drive have been procured for remote areas with difficult terrains and limited access to reliable electricity. UNICEF supported in EVM Assessment in Jharkhand. UNICEF supported NCCVMRC in capacity building of 105 cold chain technicians and cold chain handlers and states in capacity building of supervisory cadre (Gujarat).,Out of 60 sites designated by the GoI\, 96% of targeted installation sites for WIC-WIF are ready. 100% sites have received the WICs/WIFs. Installation of WIC/WIF have been completed at 4 sites and is ongoing at 6 sites. ILRs have been received and deployed for operations at 1389 sites (100%) across 34 states. The revised training SOPs for the ILRs have been developed and communicated to all states for capacity building of 559 Cold Chain Technicians in districts receiving the equipment. In addition\, the national level needs assessment for requirement of SDDs has been completed. Overall\, based on current information from NCCMIS\, a total of 960 cold chain points have been identified for strengthening with supply of SDDs. The revised training SOPs for SDDs will be developed based on product specifications after supply.,During the reporting period\, technical and human resources support helped develop local plans to overcome vaccine demand-related barriers. In high-risk communities in 14 states\, CSOs have reached over 77\,000 caregivers with routine immunization messages in September and 806 LODOR children (Left Out Drop Out Refusal) were immunized. In 19 districts\, CSOs have supported the Pulse Polio Campaign through house visits to re-enforce polio and immunization messages. 723 CBO members\, 177 influencers and 194 frontline workers have arranged 76 community consultations during the reporting period and 19\,000 people were reached through the face-to-face engagement activities and reminders for routine immunization sent through WhatsApp messages. In Assam\, religious influencers of the Muslim community have successfully helped immunize 120 children of resistant families. Mobile application has been launched by CSOs partners and data of 40\,000 families have been registered for RI tracking. The application is also a repository for communication materials to be used by health workers during the home visits. In October\, BRIDGE training evaluation report was launched. Findings discuss that 72.7% trained FLWs prepared village level communication plan and that training and communication materials need to be further adaptive to non Hindi speaking states. For Knowledge\, significant difference between trained (70%) and untrained (61%) FLWs? knowledge on disease prevented by Hepatitis B. The FLWs reported positive influence of the training on communication skills for interacting with parents and caregivers (87%). Trained FLWs were found more likely to target left out children than untrained FLWs and finally\, Overall\, 40% FLWs recalled all the key RI messages discussed in the training\, which indicates the cascaded training approach needs to be revisited.,As a part of the resumption of Immunization services in the states\, post lockdown\, the focus has been renewed in the states on RI and along with it the MR elimination planning has been activated. In the states of UP\, Bihar\, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan\, the MoHFW's communication planning formats for MR\, 7 series ( for state\, district\, block levels) have been used to develop communication plans.The Health officials are reviewing the plans with the teams.

UNICEF supported MoHFW and States to conduct RI reviews and to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on RI. UNICEF supported MoHFW in development and regular updating of RI guidelines in the COVID-19 pandemic setting\, including staggered RI sessions and the use of COVID-19 appropriate behaviors like use of masks\, physical distancing\, and handwashing. UNICEF also supported in the PCV introduction (UP\, Odisha\, Telangana\, Maharashtra\, West Bengal) and in the design and implementation of a special catch-up campaign for RI (Mission Ramdhenu in North-East states covering 72\,777 children aged 0-2 years). UNICEF supported in implementation of tribal RI strategy in 2 districts and urban RI strategy in 3 corporations in Maharashtra. UNICEF provided support for cold chain assessment to MoHFW and states and in setting up of new cold chain points (Chhattisgarh\, Nagaland\, Jharkhand) and mapping of health facilities requiring solar equipment across India. New CCE procurement for COVID-19 vaccine introduction has indirectly benefited target infants & pregnant women. UNICEF supported in revision of RI monitoring formats\, hosted on the Supportive Supervision app\, to include COVID-19 behavior specific questions. In Q3 2021 alone\, 35\,094 RI and 33\,339 COVID-19 vaccination session sites were monitored using modified checklists. UNICEF leveraged partnerships with CSO (Doctors for You in Maharashtra to conduct 230 outreach sessions and 236 camps for immunization) and private sector (pediatricians in Gujarat) to strengthen RI.\nOut of all CCE\, 480 solar direct drive have been procured for remote areas with difficult terrains and limited access to reliable electricity. UNICEF supported in EVM Assessment in Jharkhand. UNICEF supported NCCVMRC in capacity building of 105 cold chain technicians and cold chain handlers and states in capacity building of supervisory cadre (Gujarat).,Out of 60 sites designated by the GoI\, 96% of targeted installation sites for WIC-WIF are ready. 100% sites have received the WICs/WIFs. Installation of WIC/WIF have been completed at 4 sites and is ongoing at 6 sites. ILRs have been received and deployed for operations at 1389 sites (100%) across 34 states. The revised training SOPs for the ILRs have been developed and communicated to all states for capacity building of 559 Cold Chain Technicians in districts receiving the equipment. In addition\, the national level needs assessment for requirement of SDDs has been completed. Overall\, based on current information from NCCMIS\, a total of 960 cold chain points have been identified for strengthening with supply of SDDs. The revised training SOPs for SDDs will be developed based on product specifications after supply.,During the reporting period\, technical and human resources support helped develop local plans to overcome vaccine demand-related barriers. In high-risk communities in 14 states\, CSOs have reached over 77\,000 caregivers with routine immunization messages in September and 806 LODOR children (Left Out Drop Out Refusal) were immunized. In 19 districts\, CSOs have supported the Pulse Polio Campaign through house visits to re-enforce polio and immunization messages. 723 CBO members\, 177 influencers and 194 frontline workers have arranged 76 community consultations during the reporting period and 19\,000 people were reached through the face-to-face engagement activities and reminders for routine immunization sent through WhatsApp messages. In Assam\, religious influencers of the Muslim community have successfully helped immunize 120 children of resistant families. Mobile application has been launched by CSOs partners and data of 40\,000 families have been registered for RI tracking. The application is also a repository for communication materials to be used by health workers during the home visits. In October\, BRIDGE training evaluation report was launched. Findings discuss that 72.7% trained FLWs prepared village level communication plan and that training and communication materials need to be further adaptive to non Hindi speaking states. For Knowledge\, significant difference between trained (70%) and untrained (61%) FLWs? knowledge on disease prevented by Hepatitis B.

In the states of UP\, Bihar\, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan\, the MoHFW's communication planning formats for MR\, 7 series ( for state\, district\, block levels) have been used to develop communication plans.The Health officials are reviewing the plans with the teams. Implementation of the activities on advocacy and social mobilization through the support of the FLWs\, CSO-CBOs and youth networks in on. The institutional partners\, IMA\, IAP \, IAPSM and Rotary have been undertaking advocacy and mobilization activities through their respective networks in the field. However\, due to COVID-19\, there has some delays in the implementation of some activities as the FLWs have been engaged in COVID-19 activities and also getting COVID-19 Infection.,To ensure that messages are reaching even more people\, especially those in rural areas\, WhatsApp has been the preferred means of communication. UNICEF has set up a WhatsApp chat bot which aims to address concerns and queries COVID-19\, including vaccination. With its vast reach and speed\, social media has played a significant part in spreading awareness and debunking myths and misinformation around immunization. Through social media campaigns\, targeted to specific audiences\, UNICEF has been advocating about the importance of immunization and vaccination. Awareness campaigns during World Immunization Week brought a deeper focus on the issues around immunization. COVID-19 brought much attention to vaccination\, both understanding it and accessing it. UNICEF have been using social listening tools and reports to inform our content and messages on COVID-19 vaccination with the specific focus to understand the perception around it and how to address these issues\, including on CAB+. Through a concerted effort\, social media graphics\, infographic and videos addressing vaccine hesitancy\, eagerness and availability were shared and promoted widely through Facebook\, Instagram\, Twitter and YouTube. To combat COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy\, UNICEF has been promoting videos from doctors\, nurses\, healthcare workers and frontline workers\, encouraging others to get themselves vaccinated.

UNICEF supported MoHFW and States to conduct RI reviews and to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on RI. UNICEF supported MoHFW in development and regular updating of RI guidelines in the COVID-19 pandemic setting\, including staggered RI sessions and the use of COVID-19 appropriate behaviors like use of masks\, physical distancing\, and handwashing. UNICEF also supported in the PCV introduction (UP\, Odisha\, Telangana\, Maharashtra\, West Bengal) and in the design and implementation of a special catch-up campaign for RI (Mission Ramdhenu in North-East states covering 72\,777 children aged 0-2 years). UNICEF supported in implementation of tribal RI strategy in 2 districts and urban RI strategy in 3 corporations in Maharashtra. UNICEF provided support for cold chain assessment to MoHFW and states and in setting up of new cold chain points (Chhattisgarh\, Nagaland\, Jharkhand) and mapping of health facilities requiring solar equipment across India. New CCE procurement for COVID-19 vaccine introduction has indirectly benefited target infants & pregnant women. UNICEF supported in revision of RI monitoring formats\, hosted on the Supportive Supervision app\, to include COVID-19 behavior specific questions. In Q3 2021 alone\, 35\,094 RI and 33\,339 COVID-19 vaccination session sites were monitored using modified checklists. UNICEF leveraged partnerships with CSO (Doctors for You in Maharashtra to conduct 230 outreach sessions and 236 camps for immunization) and private sector (pediatricians in Gujarat) to strengthen RI.\nOut of all CCE\, 480 solar direct drive have been procured for remote areas with difficult terrains and limited access to reliable electricity. UNICEF supported in EVM Assessment in Jharkhand. UNICEF supported NCCVMRC in capacity building of 105 cold chain technicians and cold chain handlers and states in capacity building of supervisory cadre (Gujarat).,Out of 60 sites designated by the GoI\, 96% of targeted installation sites for WIC-WIF are ready. 100% sites have received the WICs/WIFs. Installation of WIC/WIF have been completed at 4 sites and is ongoing at 6 sites. ILRs have been received and deployed for operations at 1389 sites (100%) across 34 states. The revised training SOPs for the ILRs have been developed and communicated to all states for capacity building of 559 Cold Chain Technicians in districts receiving the equipment. In addition\, the national level needs assessment for requirement of SDDs has been completed. Overall\, based on current information from NCCMIS\, a total of 960 cold chain points have been identified for strengthening with supply of SDDs. The revised training SOPs for SDDs will be developed based on product specifications after supply.,During the reporting period\, technical and human resources support helped develop local plans to overcome vaccine demand-related barriers. In high-risk communities in 14 states\, CSOs have reached over 77\,000 caregivers with routine immunization messages in September and 806 LODOR children (Left Out Drop Out Refusal) were immunized. In 19 districts\, CSOs have supported the Pulse Polio Campaign through house visits to re-enforce polio and immunization messages. 723 CBO members\, 177 influencers and 194 frontline workers have arranged 76 community consultations during the reporting period and 19\,000 people were reached through the face-to-face engagement activities and reminders for routine immunization sent through WhatsApp messages. In Assam\, religious influencers of the Muslim community have successfully helped immunize 120 children of resistant families. Mobile application has been launched by CSOs partners and data of 40\,000 families have been registered for RI tracking. The application is also a repository for communication materials to be used by health workers during the home visits. In October\, BRIDGE training evaluation report was launched. Findings discuss that 72.7% trained FLWs prepared village level communication plan and that training and communication materials need to be further adaptive to non Hindi speaking states. For Knowledge\, significant difference between trained (70%) and untrained (61%) FLWs? knowledge on disease prevented by Hepatitis B. The FLWs reported positive influence of the training on communication skills for interacting with parents and caregivers (87%). Trained FLWs were found more likely to target left out children than untrained FLWs and finally\, Overall\, 40% FLWs recalled all the key RI messages discussed in the training\, which indicates the cascaded training approach needs to be revisited.,As a part of the resumption of Immunization services in the states\, post lockdown\, the focus has been renewed in the states on RI and along with it the MR elimination planning has been activated. In the states of UP\, Bihar\, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan\, the MoHFW's communication planning formats for MR\, 7 series ( for state\, district\, block levels) have been used to develop communication plans.The Health officials are reviewing the plans with the teams. Implementation of the activities on advocacy and social mobilization through the support of the FLWs\, CSO-CBOs and youth networks in on. The institutional partners\, IMA\, IAP \, IAPSM and Rotary have been undertaking advocacy and mobilization activities through their respective networks in the field. However\, due to COVID-19\, there has some delays in the implementation of some activities as the FLWs have been engaged in COVID-19 activities and also getting COVID-19 Infection.,To ensure that messages are reaching even more people\, especially those in rural areas\, WhatsApp has been the preferred means of communication. UNICEF has set up a WhatsApp chat bot which aims to address concerns and queries COVID-19\, including vaccination. With its vast reach and speed\, social media has played a significant part in spreading awareness and debunking myths and misinformation around immunization. Through social media campaigns\, targeted to specific audiences\, UNICEF has been advocating about the importance of immunization and vaccination. Awareness campaigns during World Immunization Week brought a deeper focus on the issues around immunization. COVID-19 brought much attention to vaccination\, both understanding it and accessing it.

UNICEF supported MoHFW and States to conduct RI reviews and to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on RI. UNICEF supported MoHFW in development and regular updating of RI guidelines in the COVID-19 pandemic setting\, including staggered RI sessions and the use of COVID-19 appropriate behaviors like use of masks\, physical distancing\, and handwashing. UNICEF also supported in the PCV introduction (UP\, Odisha\, Telangana\, Maharashtra\, West Bengal) and in the design and implementation of a special catch-up campaign for RI (Mission Ramdhenu in North-East states covering 72\,777 children aged 0-2 years). UNICEF supported in implementation of tribal RI strategy in 2 districts and urban RI strategy in 3 corporations in Maharashtra. UNICEF provided support for cold chain assessment to MoHFW and states and in setting up of new cold chain points (Chhattisgarh\, Nagaland\, Jharkhand) and mapping of health facilities requiring solar equipment across India. New CCE procurement for COVID-19 vaccine introduction has indirectly benefited target infants & pregnant women. UNICEF supported in revision of RI monitoring formats\, hosted on the Supportive Supervision app\, to include COVID-19 behavior specific questions. In Q3 2021 alone\, 35\,094 RI and 33\,339 COVID-19 vaccination session sites were monitored using modified checklists. UNICEF leveraged partnerships with CSO (Doctors for You in Maharashtra to conduct 230 outreach sessions and 236 camps for immunization) and private sector (pediatricians in Gujarat) to strengthen RI.\nOut of all CCE\, 480 solar direct drive have been procured for remote areas with difficult terrains and limited access to reliable electricity. UNICEF supported in EVM Assessment in Jharkhand. UNICEF supported NCCVMRC in capacity building of 105 cold chain technicians and cold chain handlers and states in capacity building of supervisory cadre (Gujarat).,Out of 60 sites designated by the GoI\, 96% of targeted installation sites for WIC-WIF are ready. 100% sites have received the WICs/WIFs. Installation of WIC/WIF have been completed at 4 sites and is ongoing at 6 sites. ILRs have been received and deployed for operations at 1389 sites (100%) across 34 states. The revised training SOPs for the ILRs have been developed and communicated to all states for capacity building of 559 Cold Chain Technicians in districts receiving the equipment. In addition\, the national level needs assessment for requirement of SDDs has been completed. Overall\, based on current information from NCCMIS\, a total of 960 cold chain points have been identified for strengthening with supply of SDDs. The revised training SOPs for SDDs will be developed based on product specifications after supply.,During the reporting period\, technical and human resources support helped develop local plans to overcome vaccine demand-related barriers. In high-risk communities in 14 states\, CSOs have reached over 77\,000 caregivers with routine immunization messages in September and 806 LODOR children (Left Out Drop Out Refusal) were immunized. In 19 districts\, CSOs have supported the Pulse Polio Campaign through house visits to re-enforce polio and immunization messages. 723 CBO members\, 177 influencers and 194 frontline workers have arranged 76 community consultations during the reporting period and 19\,000 people were reached through the face-to-face engagement activities and reminders for routine immunization sent through WhatsApp messages. In Assam\, religious influencers of the Muslim community have successfully helped immunize 120 children of resistant families. Mobile application has been launched by CSOs partners and data of 40\,000 families have been registered for RI tracking. The application is also a repository for communication materials to be used by health workers during the home visits. In October\, BRIDGE training evaluation report was launched. Findings discuss that 72.7% trained FLWs prepared village level communication plan and that training and communication materials need to be further adaptive to non Hindi speaking states. For Knowledge\, significant difference between trained (70%) and untrained (61%) FLWs? knowledge on disease prevented by Hepatitis B. The FLWs reported positive influence of the training on communication skills for interacting with parents and caregivers (87%). Trained FLWs were found more likely to target left out children than untrained FLWs and finally\, Overall\, 40% FLWs recalled all the key RI messages discussed in the training\, which indicates the cascaded training approach needs to be revisited.,As a part of the resumption of Immunization services in the states\, post lockdown\, the focus has been renewed in the states on RI and along with it the MR elimination planning has been activated.
